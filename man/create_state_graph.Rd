\title{Create a State-Based Visibility Graph}
\usage{
create_state_graph(
  ts,
  states,
  method,
  directed,
  limit,
  penetrable,
  decay_factor,
  weight_agg = "sum"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{Numeric vector of time series values.}

\item{states}{Character vector of state labels for each time point. Must be
of the same length as `ts`.}

\item{method}{Character string. The visibility graph construction method:
"nvg" or "hvg".}

\item{directed}{Logical. If `TRUE`, the state-based graph will be directed.}

\item{limit}{Integer or `NULL`. Maximum temporal distance for visibility connections.}

\item{penetrable}{Integer. The number of intermediate points allowed to penetrate
the visibility line.}

\item{decay_factor}{Numeric. The temporal decay factor for edge weights.}

\item{weight_agg}{Character string. The method to aggregate edge weights between
state pairs. Options: "sum" (default), "mean", "max", "count".}
}
\value{
A square numeric matrix representing the state-based adjacency matrix,
  where rows and columns correspond to unique states. The values in the matrix
  represent the aggregated weights of connections between states.
}
\description{
Converts a time-point based visibility graph into a state-based graph by
aggregating connections between time points that belong to the same discrete states.
This is an internal helper function used by `visibility_graph()`.
