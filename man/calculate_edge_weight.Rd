\title{Calculate edge weight based on decay}
\usage{
calculate_edge_weight(i, j, decay_factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{Integer index of the first point}

\item{j}{Integer index of the second point}

\item{decay_factor}{Non-negative numeric value controlling temporal decay.
If 0, all edges have weight 1. Higher values cause faster decay.}
}
\value{
Numeric edge weight between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Computes the weight of an edge between two time points, optionally applying
temporal decay based on their distance.
}
\details{
The weight is calculated as exp(-decay_factor * distance), where distance
is the absolute difference between indices i and j.
