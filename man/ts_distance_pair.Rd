\title{Calculate Distance Between Two Time Series}
\usage{
ts_distance_pair(ts1, ts2, method = "euclidean", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts1}{A numeric vector representing the first time series.}

\item{ts2}{A numeric vector representing the second time series. Must be of the same length as `ts1`.}

\item{method}{Character string. The distance calculation method to use (e.g., "euclidean",
"manhattan", "cosine", "dtw"). See `ts_distance_methods()` for available options.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the specific distance function
(e.g., `p` for Minkowski distance).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the calculated distance between `ts1` and `ts2`.
}
\description{
A simple function to compute the distance between two individual time series (vectors).
It supports various distance metrics, leveraging both native implementations and
methods available through the `proxy` package.
