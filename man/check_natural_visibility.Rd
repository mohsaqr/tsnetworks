\title{Check natural visibility between two points}
\usage{
check_natural_visibility(x, i, j, penetrable = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector representing the time series}

\item{i}{Integer index of the first point (1-based)}

\item{j}{Integer index of the second point (1-based)}

\item{penetrable}{Non-negative integer. Number of points allowed to penetrate 
the visibility line for limited penetrable visibility graphs. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
Logical value indicating whether points i and j have natural visibility
}
\description{
Determines if two points in a time series have natural visibility according
to the natural visibility graph algorithm.
}
\details{
Natural visibility between two points exists if you can draw a straight line
between them that doesn't intersect with any intermediate points (or intersects
with at most \code{penetrable} points for LPVG variants).
